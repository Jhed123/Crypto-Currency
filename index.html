        <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies such as the dollar or euro, cryptocurrencies are decentralized and operate on blockchain technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009. Other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple have since emerged, each offering unique features and technologies.

        <h2>How Cryptocurrency Works</h2>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrencies operate using decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This provides transparency and security, as every transaction is independently verified by the network and recorded on the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cryptography ensures that these transactions are secure and unchangeable. Once recorded, transactions cannot be altered, providing a high level of trust and integrity.

        <h2>What is Blockchain Technology?</h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain technology is the backbone of cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each group of transactions is stored in a "block," and these blocks are linked together to form a "chain." This makes data on the blockchain transparent and tamper-resistant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Blockchain's decentralized nature means there is no central authority controlling the network. This increases security, reduces costs, and improves the speed of transactions.

        <h2>What is Mining?</h2>
        <p>
            Mining is the process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. This involves solving complex mathematical puzzles using computational power. Miners who successfully solve these puzzles are rewarded with newly created cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mining is essential for maintaining the security of a decentralized cryptocurrency network. It ensures that transactions are verified and prevents double-spending.

    <section id="wallet">
        <h2>Cryptocurrency Wallets</h2>
        <p>
            A cryptocurrency wallet is a tool that allows users to store, send, and receive digital currencies. Each wallet has a public key, which others can use to send cryptocurrency to the wallet, and a private key, which is used to sign transactions and access the walletâ€™s funds.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two main types of wallets: hot wallets (connected to the internet) and cold wallets (offline). Cold wallets offer a higher level of security as they are less vulnerable to hacking.
